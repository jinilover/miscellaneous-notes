# Note on Haskell/FP
Personal note in Haskell/FP, most of them concluded from reasoning instead of Haskell specific knowledge.

### 1. `(.)`
Inspired by the "applicative" chapter in the purple book.  Consider the following **pseudo code**   
`g :: b -> c`  
`g . :: (a -> b) -> a -> c` imagine there is `f :: a -> b` s.t. `g . f`    
`(g .) . :: (a1 -> a2 -> b) -> a1 -> a2 -> c` imagine there is `f :: a1 -> a2 -> b`  
`((g .) .) . :: (a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> b) -> a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> c`  

Recap **pseudo code**,  
```
  g         ::                    b  ->                   c
  g .       ::             (a3 -> b) ->             a3 -> c
 (g .) .    ::       (a2 -> a3 -> b) ->       a2 -> a3 -> c
((g .) .) . :: (a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> b) -> a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> c
```

#### Factor out `g` to point free styles
According to the previous findings, we can deduce the type of `(.).(.)`

`(g .) .` is  
`((.) g) . ` is  
`(.) ((.) g)` is  
`(.).(.) $ g`, factoring out `g` gives   
`(.).(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a1 -> a2 -> b) -> a1 -> a2 -> c`  

Similarly  
`((g .) .) . ` is  
`((.).(.) $ g) .` is  
`(.) ((.).(.) $ g)` is  
`(.).(.).(.) $ g` is  
`(.).(.).(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> b) -> a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> c`

Another discovery  
```
(.)         :: (b -> c) ->             (a3 -> b) ->             a3 -> c
(.).(.)     :: (b -> c) ->       (a2 -> a3 -> b) ->       a2 -> a3 -> c
(.).(.).(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> b) -> a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> c
```

#### Altervative way to find the types w/o using `g`
Because
```
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
```
Therefore in `(.).(.)`, to compose with the right `(.)`, the left `(.)` must be `((a -> b) -> a -> c) -> ???`.  

Since `(.)` must be something like `(b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c`,

compare `((a -> b) -> a -> c) -> ???` with `(b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c`,

`((a -> b) -> a -> c)` is analogous to `(b -> c)`.

Therefore `???` is `(a1 -> a -> b) -> a1 -> a -> c` which can be tidied as `(a1 -> a2 -> b) -> a1 -> a2 -> c`.
So `(.).(.)` is `(b -> c) -> (a1 -> a2 -> b) -> a1 -> a2 -> c`.

### 2. Setter
This is inspired by the lens derivation note.  Suppose  
```
mapOnTraversable :: Traversable t => (a -> b) -> t a -> t b
mapOnTraversable f = runIdentity . traverse (Identity . f)
```

If the data structure is not `Traversable`, we replace `traverse` by another function, say, `setter` such that  
`mapBySetter setter f = runIdentity . setter (Identity . f)` is  
`mapBySetter setter f = (runIdentity . ) setter (Identity . f)` is  
`mapBySetter setter f = (runIdentity . ) . setter . (Identity . ) $ f` is
`mapBySetter setter = (runIdentity . ) . setter . (Identity . )`  
Because  
`(Identity . ) :: (a1 -> a2) -> a1 -> Identity a2`  
`(runIdentity . ) :: (a -> Identity c) -> a -> c`  
Therefore  
`setter :: (a1 -> Identity a2) -> a -> Identity c`  
`mapBySetter :: ((a1 -> Identity a2) -> a -> Identity c) -> (a1 -> a2) -> a -> c`  
rewritten as  
`mapBySetter :: Setter s t a b -> (a -> b) -> s -> t`  
where  
`type Setter s t a b = (a -> Identity b) -> s -> Identity t`  


### 3. `Traversable`
2 main functions:
* `traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)`
* `sequenceA :: Applicative f => t (f a) -> f (t a)`

This problem comes from the purple book.
```
data Query = Query
data SomeObj = SomeObj
data IoOnlyObj = IoOnlyObj
data Err = Err

decodeFn = undefined :: String -> Either Err SomeObj

fetchFn = undefined :: Query -> IO [String]

makeIoOnlyObj = undefined :: [SomeObj] -> IO [(SomeObj, IoOnlyObj)]

pipelineFn :: Query -> IO (Either Err [(SomeObj, IoOnlyObj)])
pipelineFn = undefined
```

Purpose is to implement `pipelineFn`

Solve by types, approach:
* starting from `fetchFn`, and `fetchFn`, `decodeFn`, `makeIoOnlyObj` can be "connected" with each other.
* Suppose `:t query` is `Query`
* `:t fetchFn query` is `IO [String]`
* `[]` is `Traversable`, therefore `:t traverse decodeFn <$> fetchFn query` is `IO (Either Err [SomeObj])`
* `IO` is `Monad`, `makeIoOnlyObj` returns `IO`, `Either a` is `Traversable`, therefore `:t traverse decodeFn <$> fetchFn query >>= (traverse makeIoOnlyObj)` is `IO (Either Err [(SomeObj, IoOnlyObj)])`.  Done!
* `fetchFn query` is `IO` and `traverse makeIoOnlyObj` returns `IO`, the implemenation can be re-written as `fetchFn query >>= (traverse makeIoOnlyObj . traverse decodeFn)`
* To take out the `query` for a point-free style, it can be re-written as `(>>= traverse makeIoOnlyObj . traverse decodeFn) . fetchFn`


## `IORef`, `STRef`
Both achive mutability in side-effect free manner using different means.

### `IORef`
`IORef` provides mutable value in `IO` monad.  As the name implies, it's reference to some data that allows functions to change this data and these functions must operate in `IO`.  That is, the data can only be modified by going through `IO`.

### `STRef`
`STRef` provdes mutable value in `ST` monad where the mutable memory is only used internally, i.e. the functions must be operate in `ST`.

References:
* https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad/ST
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5545517/difference-between-state-st-ioref-and-mvar?rq=1

## `MVar`
`MVar` is used for multi threading, i.e. `MVar a` is used to pass information between threads.  As analogy, it can be regarded as `IORef` with locks.

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15439966/when-why-use-an-mvar-over-a-tvar

## `ByteString`
It's a space-efficient representation of a `Word8` vector.  It is not intended to be a string and is an array of bytes that comes in both strict and lazy forms.  It can be used to store 8-bit character strings and also to handle binary data.   This type is not for text manipulation as it doesnâ€™t support Unicode. It's de facto standard type for networking, serialization, and parsing in Haskell.

## `Text`
`Text` provides an efficient packed Unicode text type.

## `String` vs `Text`
If the application targets at processing large amounts of character oriented data and/or various encodings, then it should use `Text`.  Otherwise, using `String` is fine.

## Performance/Strictness/Laziness
Because of laziness, the compiler can't evaluate a function argument and pass the value to the function, it has to record the expression in the heap in a suspension (or thunk) in case it is evaluated later. Storing and evaluating suspensions is costly, and unnecessary if the expression was going to be evaluated anyway.

* https://wiki.haskell.org/Performance/Strictness

## Using a type signature to tell if a function is pure or not
A function is pure such that its result only depends on the provided input.  To tell if a function is pure or not, use ```:type```.  If the result type prefixes with ```IO```, this function is impure.  E.g.
```
ghci> :type readFile
readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
```
This IO monad allows you to build any "impure" task such as database update.

## Variance, positive/negative position

Positive position means the type variable is the **result/output/range/codomain** of the function, e.g. `Maybe a`, `r -> a`.  Under this condition, the data type is covariant with `a` s.t. a **functor** instance, but not contravariant instance, can be made for the "context" of `a`

Negative position means the type variable is the **argument/input/domain** of the function, e.g. `data MakeInt a = MakeInt (a -> Int)`.  Under this condition, the data type is contravariant with `a` s.t. a **contravariant** instance, but not functor instance, can be made for the "context" of `a`

Reference:
* https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2016/11/covariance-contravariance 

## Polymorphic functions
Functions that have type variables are called polymorphic functions.  E.g.
```
ghci> :t head
head :: [a] -> a
```
```a``` is a type variable.  That means ```head``` is a polymorphic function that works on a list of any element types.

## Overloaded functions
Polymorphic functions having the type variables constrainted by type class.  E.g.
```
ghci> :t sum
sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
```

## Pay attention when the name of type constructor and value constructor are the same
People new to FP usually have this mistake.  In defining an ADT, a type constructor and a value constructor have the same name.

Example
```Haskell
data Vector a = Vector a a a deriving (Show)
```
`Vector a` is the **type**, `Vector a a a` is the **value**.  Therefore, `Vector a` but **not** ```Vector a a a``` should be put in the function's type signature.
```Haskell
vplus :: (Num t) => Vector t -> Vector t -> Vector t
(Vector i j k) `vplus` (Vector l m n) = Vector (i+l) (j+m) (k+n)
```

## `newtype` is preferred to `data` iunder certain conditions
For a given type, if there is only 1 data constructor containing single field.  Key word ```newtype``` can be used instead of ```data```.
Example.
```Haskell
data Hm = Hm Int
```
is better written as
```Haskell
newtype Hm = Hm Int
```
This safeguards a mistake of assigning an ```Int``` value to the ```Hm``` type during compilation.
Before compiling to an executable, it generates the source code by removing the ```newtype```.
This avoids the runtime overhead of wrapping/unwrapping for the underlying value.

Type variable is also allowed in ```newtype```.  Example
```Haskell
newtype Hm a = Hm a
```
```Haskell
newtype Hm a = Hm {getValue :: a}
```

## Reuse type class
Make a type class be subclass of another type class.
```Haskell
class Eq a => Num a where
  -- required behaviour for a Num
```
If ```a``` is ```Num```, it should also be ```Eq```.  i.e ```Num``` is ```Eq```

Type class is used for function declaration, not for data type declaration.  To make a data type be the type class, the type class instance should be defined accordingly.  In some conditions, a type class instance can be defined by re-using another type class instance.  E.g.
```Haskell
instance (Eq m) => Eq (Maybe m) where
  -- implement Eq's required behaviour for the type Maybe m
```
To make ```Maybe m``` be a type class ```Eq```, it should require ```m``` be a type class ```Eq```.  The purpose is similar to requiring a type be a particular type class in defining a function.  E.g.
```Haskell
(+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a
```

## `Contravariant`
```
class Contravariant f where
    contramap :: (a -> b) -> f b -> f a
```

### Contravariant examples
In `r -> a`, `(r ->)` is a functor.  
In `a -> r`, `(-> r)` is a contravariant.

```
newtype ReverseFunction r a = ReverseFunction { func :: a -> r}

instance Contravariant (ReverseFunction r) where
    contramap f (ReverseFunction g) = ReverseFunction $ g . f
```

Therefore Json encoder is contravariant.

## `Generic` 101
Idea: all data types can be described by either sum type or product type or both.  Therefore there is a generic way to represent the data types s.t. the compiler can generate this common, low-level data representation automatically.  This idea is implemented using the type class as follows.

```
class Generic a where
    -- Convert a value to its generic representation
    from :: a -> Rep a

    -- Convert the generic representation back to the value
    to   :: Rep a -> a

```

To automatically generate generic representation for a data type, GHC extension `DeriveGeneric` is applied as follows.

```
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

import GHC.Generics (Generic)

data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }
  deriving (Generic, Show)
```

Representing a data type in generic representation allow functions (e.g. serialization or deserialization) to be written in a way that they can work with any data type rather than being hardcoded.  `aeson` are great examples of functions that work on a data type's generic representation.

```
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

import GHC.Generics (Generic)
import Data.Aeson (ToJSON, FromJSON)

data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }
  deriving (Generic, Show)

instance ToJSON Person
instance FromJSON Person
```

Note: The `Generic` type class is closely related to the isomorphism concept.

## `Exception` type class
* We can throw exceptions in pure function using `throw`.  But this is **highly not recommended**.Â  Instead, we should use `throwIO` whose return type is IO a.Â  The reason is pure code cannot catch exceptions.  Exceptions can only be handled within `IO`.Â  These handled exceptions are `Exception` instances.
* We can define Exception instances for application purposes.
* Even if we define the Exception instance, when we throw it by, say, `throwIO`, it will be wrapped automatically inside `SomeException` so that it can be caught by `catch` or `catchAll`.
* Consider an example,Â `handle handleHttpException ma` whereÂ `handleHttpException :: MonadCatch m => HttpException -> m a` andÂ `HttpException`Â isÂ `Exception`.Â  If another exception type is thrown during runtime, it won't be handled by `handleHttpException`, and be propagated as an unhandled exception, and depending on how the program is structured, it will be either
  * Caught by another handler up the chain or
  * Cause the program to terminate with an unhandled exception error.
* Given the note mentioned before, we can see thatÂ `Exception` does not represents all GHC runtime exceptions.Â  But GHC runtime generated exceptions are `Exception`Â instances.Â  Therefore these GHC runtime exceptions can be handled by the `Exception` framework.
* When to use Exception or not?Â  I think if the code is **pure**, we can define programmatic exceptions which is more readable.

## Pragmas
A pragma is a directive to the compiler.  It tells the compiler to enable a language extension that processes input in a way beyond what the standard provides for.

### GHC extensions learnt from "Haskell in depth"

* `OverloadedStrings` p. 14
* `DeriveAnyClass` p. 24
* `StandaloneDeriving` p. 31
* `NoImplicitPrelude` p. 105

### 1. `forall` and RankNTypes
E.g.
```Haskell
applyToTuple :: ([a] -> Int) -> ([b], [c]) -> (Int, Int)
applyToTuple = \f -> \(x, y) -> (f x, f y)
```

It fails to compile because types ```a```, ```b``` and ```c``` do not match.  Theoretically the function of type ```[a] -> Int``` should be applied to any list.  Under this scenario, it needs something call ```RankNTypes```.  Solution:
* Enable GHCI extension
* Use keyword ```forall```

```Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}
applyToTuple :: (forall a. [a] -> Int) -> ([b],[c]) -> (Int, Int)
applyToTuple = \f -> \(x, y) -> (f x, f y)
```

#### Reason
Type signatureâ€™s type variables are implicitly **universally** quantified by an **invisible** `forall` section.  Therefore 
```
applyToTuple :: ([a] -> Int) -> ([b], [c]) -> (Int, Int)
``` 
is actually compiled to 
```
applyToTuple :: forall a b c. ([a] -> Int) -> ([b], [c]) -> (Int, Int)
```

The type checker expects type variables a, b and c to be different concrete types.  So ```[a] -> Int``` might become ```[Char] -> Int``` or ```[Int] -> Int``` or whatsoever after a function is passed to ```applyToTuple```.  ```(f x, f y)``` seeks to apply that function to two lists of different types â€“ however, any version of that function, i.e. ```[Char] -> Int``` or ```[Int] -> Int``` or whatsoever, expects its list to always be of 1 concrete type only.

If it's re-written as 
```
applyToTuple :: (forall a. [a] -> Int) -> ([b],[c]) -> (Int, Int)
``` 
which is compiled to 
```
applyToTuple :: forall b c. (forall a. [a] -> Int) -> ([b],[c]) -> (Int, Int)
```
(`a` and `b`) or (`a` and `c`) will be in **different scopes**.

Note for the modified `applyToTuple`:
* A variable is **universally quantified** when the consumer of the expression it appears in can choose what it will be.  E.g. `b` and `c`.  Because `applyToTuple` users can choose what the types `b` and `c` are.
* A variable is **existentially quantified** when the consumer of the expression it appears in have to deal with the fact that the choice was made for him.  E.g. `a`.  Because it has to deal wih any type given to it.
* Once entered inside `applyToTuple`, `b` and `c` are then **existentially quantified** because this function user has already chosen the types from calling.

### 2. `forall` and `ExistentialQuantification`
In this case `forall` is used on defining a type.  E.g. 
```
data SomeException = forall e . Exception e => SomeException e
```
Usually it's an error because any type variable appearing on the right must also appear on the left.  It can be fixed by
```
data SomeException e = SomeException e
```
However if `e` always belongs to a type class, say, `Exception`, then all functions using `SomeException` should be declared in this way
```
func :: Exception e => SomeException e
```
Using existential types solves this problem.
```
{-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-}
data SomeException = forall e. Exception e => SomeException e
func :: SomeException
```

#### Why existentials?
Existentials are always about throwing type information away. Why would we want to do that? The answer is: sometimes we want to work with types that we donâ€™t know at compile time. The types typically depend on the state of external world: they could depend on userâ€™s input, on contents of a file weâ€™re trying to parse, etc.

### 3. `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` - make a type class derivable
Suppose there is a type class from which an instance has been created for a type.  If there is a newtype contains this type and we want to reuse this type class instance for this newtype, we can use the pragma ```GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving```.
Example
```Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}

class TooMany a where
  tooMany :: a -> Bool

instance TooMany Int where
  tooMany n = n > 42

newtype Goats = Goats Int deriving (Eq, Show, TooMany)
```

Another sample usage of `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving`
```
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving  #-}
newtype MyApp a = MyApp {
      runApp :: ReaderT WebAPIAuth IO a
    } deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadIO,
                MonadThrow, MonadCatch, MonadMask,
                MonadReader WebAPIAuth)
```

### 4. `InstanceSigs` - allows type signature in defining the type class instance
In defining the type class instance, it is unnecessary and not allowed to write the function type signature.  E.g.
```Haskell
class Functor' f where
  fmap' :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

instance Functor' ((->) a) where
  fmap' :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)  -- type signature not allowed
  fmap' = (.)
```
It will raise the error
```
    Illegal type signature in instance declaration:
      fmap' :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
    (Use InstanceSigs to allow this)
    In the instance declaration for â€˜Functor' ((->) a)â€™
```
To get through the restriction, use `InstanceSigs`.
```Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE InstanceSigs #-}

class Functor' f where
  fmap' :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

instance Functor' ((->) a) where
  fmap' :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
  fmap' = (.)
```

### 5. Data declaration with constraint
Type constraints usually happen on functions.  Sometimes it also happens on a data constructor.  Suppose you want to construct a type by using a type argument where this type belongs to a type class.  E.g.
```Haskell
data WeakenFactor a => Weaken a = Weaken { weakenFactor :: a, weakenHealth :: Health }
```
That means `a` must belong to type class `WeakenFactor`.

Alternatively, it can be presented as a function as follows:
```Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}  -- this pragama is needed
data Weaken a where -- starts with data, like class
  Weaken :: WeakenFactor a => a -> Health -> Weaken a
```

https://wiki.haskell.org/Data_declaration_with_constraint

### 6. Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs)
GADT can be used to solve the problem mentioned before.  

If we want to define a data constructor in the following way, notice the double colons.
```
data Expr a where
  I   :: Expr Int
```
GADTs extension should be enabled.  

If we want to use smart constructor, it can also apply GADT
```
data Expr a where
  I   :: Int  -> Expr Int
  B   :: Bool -> Expr Bool
  Add :: Expr Int -> Expr Int -> Expr Int
  Mul :: Expr Int -> Expr Int -> Expr Int
  Eq  :: Eq a => Expr a -> Expr a -> Expr Bool
```

The key is to allow a data constructor's **return type to be specified directly**
E.g. `-> Expr Int`, `-> Expr Bool`

In this case, GADT makes use of phantom type but it's more type safe than phantom type because e.g. 
```
I 1 `Eq` B True
``` 
will raise compilation error because `a` can track the type.  For more information, refer to https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT.  

### 7. `RecordWildCards` for `{..}` on data constructor having record syntax
This is for code simplicity.  E.g.
```Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards #-}
data Stage = Egg { stateChgdTime :: UTCTime,
                   currTemp :: Int ,  -- notice currTemp
                   energyToHatch :: Int,
                   health :: Health }
...
process Egg{..} _ (_, Just IncreaseTemp) allConsts
  | currTemp == (fatalMaxTemp . eggConsts) allConsts = -- currTemp is called directly
    return "The egg has reached the max temperature, you've cooked it"
```
By using `RecordWildCards`, it doesn't need to assign a variable to `Egg` in order to get its current temperature via `currTemp egg`.

### 8. `ViewPatterns`
Enable simple syntax to match a pattern that requires another function to process.  E.g.
```
{-# LANGUAGE ViewPatterns #-}
import qualified Data.Text as T

f :: T.Text -> Either String T.Text
f (T.splitOn ":" -> [_, _]) = Right undefined
f s = Left "input string must be s1:s2 format"
```
The benefit is applied on
```
(T.splitOn ":" -> [_, _])
```
Because
```
T.splitOn ":" :: T.Text -> [T.Text]
```

Note:
* The value to be matched doesn't need to be specified
* Parentheses must be needed

### 9. `FunctionalDependencies`
It is used on multiple parameter type classes.  
E.g. `class Monad m => MonadError e m | m -> e where`, `m` determines `e`, it means for a given `m` value, it should be related to at most one `e` value in the `MonadError` type class.  E.g. when `instance MonadError IOException IO where` is defined, `instance MonadError String IO where` will get compilation error.

Another easy example comes from https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/type-families-and-pokemon.

Suppose there are 3 types of pokemons - `Fire`, `Water`, `Grass` and 3 types of pokemon moves - `FireMove`, `WaterMove`, `GrassMove` such that 
```
data Fire = Charmander | Charmeleon | Charizard
data Water = Squirtle | Wartortle | Blastoise
data Grass = Bulbasaur | Ivysaur | Venusaur

data FireMove = Ember | FlameThrower | FireBlast
data WaterMove = Bubble | WaterGun
data GrassMove = VineWhip
```

At this stage, we can tell `Fire` is related to `FireMove` only and so on.  Suppose we want to define a function to get a move from a pokemon, we can define a type class as follows:
```
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses, FunctionalDependencies #-}

class Pokemon pokemon move | pokemon -> move where
  pickMove :: pokemon -> move

instance Pokemon Fire FireMove where
    pickMove Charmander = Ember
    pickMove Charmeleon = FlameThrower
    pickMove Charizard = FireBlast

instance Pokemon Water WaterMove where
    pickMove Squirtle = Bubble
    pickMove _ = WaterGun

instance Pokemon Grass GrassMove where
    pickMove = const VineWhip
```
Meaningless relationship such as `instance Pokemon Fire WaterMove` won't pass the compilation.

### 10. `TypeFamilies`
Besides `FunctionalDependencies`, `TypeFamilies` is an alternative to type check the pokemon example.
```
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}
class Pokemon pokemon where
  data Move pokemon :: *
  pickMove :: pokemon -> Move pokemon

instance Pokemon Fire where
  data Move Fire = Ember | FlameThrower | FireBlast
  pickMove Charmander = Ember
  pickMove Charmeleon = FlameThrower
  pickMove Charizard = FireBlast

instance Pokemon Water where
  data Move Water = Bubble | WaterGun
  pickMove Squirtle = Bubble
  pickMove _ = WaterGun

instance Pokemon Grass where
  data Move Grass = VineWhip
  pickMove = const VineWhip
```

Comparing with `FunctionalDependencies`, `TypeFamilies` seems a bit less trivial in the beginning, however it has the advantages of less type parameter.

### 11. `OverloadedStrings`
When this extension is set, 2 things happen:
* Type of string literal is changed to type `IsString a => a` where `fromString :: String -> a` is delcared in this type class.
* `"sample"` is changed to `fromString "sample"`.

`Text` is `instance IsString Text`, therefore `b = "sample" :: Text`, type of `b` is `Text`.

`ByteString` is also `instance IsString ByteString`, therefore `b = "sample" :: ByteString`, type of `b` is `ByteString`.

### 12. `DeriveGeneric`
It has been explained in the section of data type generic representation.

### 13. `DeriveAnyClass`
Get back to the `aeson` example again.
```
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

import GHC.Generics (Generic)
import Data.Aeson (ToJSON, FromJSON)

data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }
  deriving (Generic, Show)

instance ToJSON Person
instance FromJSON Person
```

We can remove the last 2 lines by deriving `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` as follows.
```
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveAnyClass #-} 
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

import GHC.Generics (Generic)
import Data.Aeson (FromJSON, ToJSON) 

data Person = Person { name :: String , age :: Int } deriving (Show, Generic, FromJSON, ToJSON)
```

Note: `Show`, `Eq`, `Ord` have built-in support for deriving, `DeriveAnyClass` is not required for these type classes.
